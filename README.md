# Mobile Application Development — Key Considerations & Industry Practices

A [Slidev](https://sli.dev)-powered presentation for a 1-hour seminar on mobile application development, covering emerging technologies, practical patterns, and career insights.

## Two Versions

| File | Style | Slides | Best For |
|------|-------|--------|----------|
| `slides.md` (default) | Visual, analogy-driven, less text | ~27 | Live presenting to a general audience |
| `slides-detailed.md` | Text-heavy, code-rich, comprehensive | ~35 | Technical audience or self-study handout |

To switch versions, rename the file you want to `slides.md` (Slidev's default entry).

## Tech Stack

- **Slidev** – Markdown-based presentation framework (Vue.js + Vite)
- **Tailwind CSS** – Utility-first styling via Slidev's default theme
- **Mermaid** – Diagrams rendered in slides
- **pnpm** – Package manager

## Setup

### Prerequisites

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) >= 18
- [pnpm](https://pnpm.io/) >= 9

```bash
# Install pnpm if you don't have it

## Cookbook (Hands-On Activity)

The `cookbook/` directory contains a complete Flutter + BLoC exercise:

1. **`counter_event.dart`** — Event definitions (user actions)
2. **`counter_state.dart`** — Immutable state class
3. **`counter_bloc.dart`** — Business logic mapping events → states
4. **`counter_screen.dart`** — UI that reads state and dispatches events
5. **`main.dart`** — App entry point with BlocProvider
6. **`counter_bloc_test.dart`** — Unit tests using bloc_test

Each file includes commented challenges for attendees to extend the app:
- Add a multiply button
- Track operation history
- Persist state with SharedPreferences

See [`cookbook/README.md`](cookbook/README.md) for the full setup guide.

## Customization

### Changing the Theme Colors

Edit `styles/base.css`:

```css
:root {
  --slidev-theme-primary: #6C5CE7;   /* Purple - headings, accents */
  --slidev-theme-secondary: #1B1464; /* Dark blue - backgrounds */
  --slidev-theme-accent: #00D2D3;    /* Teal - highlights */
}
```

### Adding Slides

Add new slides to `slides.md` separated by `---`. Use Slidev features:

- `v-click` for step-by-step reveals
- Mermaid code blocks for diagrams
- Tailwind classes for layout (`grid`, `flex`, `gap-*`)
- Speaker notes in `<!-- comments -->`
